            <p>At World Of Linux we are very passionate about free and open source software. We believe that there 
            is a need for more beginner-friendly and user-friendly resources to teach people the Linux command 
            line - starting with the absolute basics.</p>
            <p>We want to provide an easy way for people to learn Linux and Bash without having to read 
            through endless material (man pages).</p>
